# Description

Chip-8 Emulator written in Golang. 

## Sidenote
This was a really fun and rewarding project to work on! I learned a lot about how the CPU works and emudev along with a new language which has been a pleasure to work with. I also made a dummy version of Pong with Python awhile back and it was really neat playing the actual game itself.
